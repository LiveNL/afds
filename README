SIMULATION ASSIGNMENT THE UITHOFLIJN

In this folder our Report for this simulation assignment can be found, Report.pdf.

Next to that there's our simulation implemented in C#.
This implementation can be run by:

`dotnet run`

It will execute a simulation based on the input date specified in the data folder. In normal cases the following files will be used:

rates_a.csv
rates_b.csv
exit_rates_a.csv
exit_rates_b.csv

Next to that there are the artificial input files, and their outputs.

The simulation will run 100 times, and the output will be all average results which can be best represented in a csv file. This can be done with: `dotnet run > output.csv`.

The number of runs can be changed to 1 in the code, in `Program.cs`, in which case a summary of the results is given in a more readable format.

If the number of runs is changed to anything other than 1, it needs to be updated in `Statistics.cs` as well.
